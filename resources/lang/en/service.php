            <p> The text is not returned to the client until it has passed all of our quality controls. All translations are done by native, specialised translators and are then reviewed by our in-house staff. Our quality-control process covers form (format, spelling, figures and ensuring nothing is missing), content (comprehension, specialised language and terminology) and style (such as appropriate register for the target audience.)
We at OmniNuance are familiar with the latest technology and use all of the currently available media, such as computer-assisted translation programs (translation memories) and terminology extraction and management tools. Our desktop publishing infrastructure means we can process and create texts in practically all known formats. Translations may be divided into five main types:</p>',

            This category includes brochures, multimedia presentations, scripts for corporate or product videos, package inserts, slogans, advertising campaigns, websites and so on.

          </p>
          <p>
          Our services in this field include everything from creative or spoken translations to copywriting. Advertising translation requires a particular stylistic flair and linguistic creativity. We actively seek these skills in our translators. Depending on the importance of the text or where it will appear, it may be advisable for several different people to take part in creating it. We also have an advertising department, which offers support and advice for large-scale projects.

            <p><span> Do you need to translate a website? At OmniNuance we are experts in translating websites to guarantee they enjoy the same success as in their home country</span>Today with ever more resources available for design and programming, website development is becoming increasingly sophisticated. If you are interested in localising your website, just let us know the address (URL) where it is hosted and our technical experts will perform a careful analysis to determine its structure and identify all the translatable text. In this way, we can give you a customised offer. In the case of dynamic or data-generated sites, we can contact the administrator of your website to request the corresponding files.</p>  
            <p>Generally speaking, satisfactory localisation includes not only user-visible text, but also the hidden text in the form of metatags, graphics (interactive fields, buttons and other elements), CGI’s and multimedia components. Localisation also includes the correct integration of additional languages into the website tree, which means updating the corresponding links and possibly editing the homepage, Flash files and so on. The final project as we deliver it to the client is a fully functional and integrated version of the website in the desired language, so you have nothing else to do</p> 
            <p>
              OmniNuance has been involved in the localisation of many websites and continues to work on updating them. Whether it is programming or design that you have in mind, we have qualified professionals with advanced skills in the most common programs, languages and tools, such as HTML, PHP, XML, Flash, Java, JavaScript, CGI/Perl and more.

'interpreting' => '<h4><a href="#">INTERPRETING</a></h4>
            <p>Whether it is a business meeting, event, training, summit, audit or interview, when people come together from around the world, the most important thing is that they understand one another. Ideas, advancements, policies and innovations are too important to be lost in translation.
        Interpretation facilitates conversations between parties who do not speak the same language. Professional interpreters listen to conversation in one language and communicate that content in another. 

        </p> <p> <h5>Types of interpretation</h5>
        Simultaneous interpretation. The interpreter uses specialized equipment to listen in one language, while interpreting the content into another language.
        Consecutive interpretation. The interpreter provides an interpretation in the target language after the speaker has finished speaking in the source language. 
        Whisper interpretation. Someone speaks and an interpreter whispers that message into the ear of another person in their preferred language.</p> ', 
'desktop_publishing' => '<h4><a href="#">Desktop publishing (DTP)</a></h4>
            <p>The shift from print to digital documentation only sharpens the need for professional-grade desktop publishing (DTP) when localizing your business presence. You need keen editorial skills, total flexibility in assembling data from many sources, and skill with the latest publishing software. That’s a lot to ask of employees already working overtime to grow your business in new markets.  </p>
